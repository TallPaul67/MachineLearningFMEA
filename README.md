# The Machine Learning FMEA Repository
Repository for the Machine Learning Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (ML FMEA) Template.  The ML FMEA is detailed within the SAE World Congress 2025 publication, "Introducing the ML FMEA" by Paul Schmitt, Bodo Seifert, Jerry Lopez, Mario Bijelic, Felix Heide, Krzysztof Pennar

## Introduction
Several challenges remain in deploying Machine Learning (ML) into safety-critical applications across industries such as automotive, autonomous vehicles, medical automation, industrial robotics, and aerospace. This repository introduces a safe machine learning approach tailored for safety-critical industries, combining **ML best practices** with the **Process Failure Mode & Effects Analysis (PFMEA)** framework. 

The **ML FMEA Template** provided here is a practical tool designed to:
- Systematically identify, prioritize, and mitigate risks throughout the ML development pipeline.
- Promote risk transparency and communication between development teams and safety experts.
- Tailor known best practices to minimize potential failure points in ML applications.

This repository accompanies the methodology described in our paper, offering a **populated ML FMEA template** to help development teams manage and communicate risks effectively.

## Features
- **Step-by-step framework:** Aligns ML development with PFMEA principles.
- **Customizable template:** Adaptable to various safety-critical applications.
- **Built-in guidance:** Includes examples of common failure causes and mitigations at each pipeline step.
- **Holistic approach:** Considers the ML pipeline as a value-add process, not just the resulting model.
